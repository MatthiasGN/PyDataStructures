'''3 Data Types
Looking at data types once more. Most of my study will be done on the readme but anything extra can go here.

What different types of data structures exist in Python?

Primitive:
- Characters
- Integers
- Floats
- Booleans

Non-Primitive (built-ins):
- Lists
- Dictionaries
- Sets
- Tuples

Non-Primitive (user-defined):
- Queues
- Deques
- Stacks
- LinkedLists
- Trees
- etc
