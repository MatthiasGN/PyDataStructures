# PyDataStructures
What we use to organise, edit and manipulate our data.

### Classification
Classified as either **primitive** or **non-primitive**. Easiest differentiation is that non-primitive data types can hold primitive data types, but opposite is not true.

### User Defined Data Structures
These are the focus of this repository. User defined data structures are non-primitive, and also not directly supported by Python but can be built fairly simply. First, some concepts:
- First-In/First-Out (**FIFO**): the first element is processed first and the newest added element is processed last. E.g. **queue**
- Last-In/First-Out (**LIFO**): also known as FILO. The first element is processed last and the newest added element is processed first. E.g. tennis balls in a can, **stack**
- Data structures are either linear (array, queue, etc) or non-linear (graph, tree, etc).
- Static vs Dynamic: the size of a static structure is fixed (e.g. array) while the size of a dynamic structure is variable. Static = faster access, dynamic = slower.
